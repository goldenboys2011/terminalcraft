Use
```
python client.py
```
To change the ip, port, and username, modify the constants at the beginning of the file.

For a better input system and colors in the terminal, but harder to read and modify code, use client_2.py. Will be updated soon. This file needs the dependency prompt_toolkit==3.0.51
